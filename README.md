# Content Suggestions 🎥✍️

This repository is the central place where you can suggest topics for my content — whether it’s **blog posts**, **YouTube videos**, **shorts**, or **live coding topics**. If there’s something you’d love to see explained, demoed, or discussed, this is the place to let me know.  

I create content mostly about:

- 🌐 **.NET and C#**  
- 📱 **Uno Platform**  
- 🧱 **Open-source development**  
- ⚡ **Developer productivity**  
- 🧩 **Fun experiments, apps, and tools**  

But feel free to suggest anything you think might fit!

## 💡 How to suggest content

1. Go to the [Issues](../../issues) tab.  
2. Click **New Issue**.  
3. Pick the appropriate template (blog, video, short, live coding).  
4. Fill in the details — the clearer your idea, the better!  

I’ll review issues, add labels (e.g., _planned_, _under review_, _needs discussion_), and update progress there.

## ✅ What makes a good suggestion?

- Clear description of the idea/topic.  
- Context — why would this be useful for developers?  
- Links/references (if applicable).

Even quick "I’d love to see X explained" is helpful!

## 🤝 Contributing
